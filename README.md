# DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms)

This repository is dedicated to my journey of learning Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using Java. The goal is to document my progress, share solutions to problems, and improve my programming skills by solving LeetCode problems and exploring various DSA concepts.

## Project Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

```
DSA/
├── src/
│   ├── arrays/       # Solutions and examples related to array problems
│   │   ├── array.java
│   │   ├── array_min.java
│   │   ├── reverse_array.java
│   │   └── swap_indexes.java
│   ├── other/        # Solutions for other data structures (to be added)
├── .gitignore        # Files and directories to ignore in the repository
└── README.md         # Documentation for the repository
```

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Java
